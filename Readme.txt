## Running the Project


## Project Summary
In this project, I can demonstrate the level of learning of different programming languages.I will be programming a semantic HTML and CSS website with a responsive layout. The interactive resume can be seen as the presentation of our career path, the information set with skills so that the recruiter looks interested.

## Development Process
### Contextualizing

#### Initial Ideas
These days, everyone, in every industry, needs a website to be competitive. <br> It was very difficult for me to develop a clear idea of how to present my CV. At first, I did not know to which IT area to direct the information.<br>The initial idea was create to just one big HTML document, and I started doing random animations with Javascript and React, but this was terribly difficult due to the very low handling I have at the moment. <br> I sat down and reconsidered how to do the project. And I discovered that I am good at posing and organizing tasks. <br> I decided to orient my CV to project management in, more professional way, therefore I made simple animations with CSS and Boostrap management for the more complicated animations.

#### Layout
The main idea behind this design was blocks of animated text content rather than a large amount of continuous content, which gave the website much more than was previously unavailable. <br>Responsiveness is one of the characteristics that I take into account, and layers that were important that can be easily seen on screens of all sizes were the key, as were some basic ideas that are highly effective for their information-rich simplicity.
I added in basic styles to edit the body, header, and footer such as font family, colour, align, margin, etc.<br>
A top or bottom navigation bar allows items in the center to carry more visual weight than all items on the side of the fold, in fact, it conserves more vertical page space than left navigation. I decided to use horizontal navigation at the bottom because of my first image on the home page - my items in the center, descending a mountain, it goes with the flow of the idea from top to bottom visualizing.

We can divide the site into 4 small parts:
1. Menu - Home site
2. Background animation - About site
3. Timeline and Progress Bar (Bootstrap) - Resumen site
4. Cards - Contact site

#### Libraries and Frameworks used
• Bootstrap 
• Javascript
• CSS

#### Colour
What are the best colors for a resume? There is no simple answer to this question. I considering that resume colors depend on the profession you are applying for and the impression you want to make. My CV was oriented towards project management, therefore more professional and neutral. Using black, white, and a third color (like blue, pink, or yellow) is a safe color scheme for any resume. Try to make a dominant color black, secondary white, and use the third to highlight the important parts. <br>
Also according to what was studied in class, black is the color of sophistication and elegance. I wanted my CV to have that detail and be connected with a personality with the following characteristics: serious, confident, strong, determined, emotionally contained, and introverted.

#### Issues Faced/Solved
Many of the interactions that I was doing with Javascript to create elements dynamic were unsuccessful. There were a number of common JavaScript problems that I had, such as logic problems. With the lack of personal time to do a completed online tutorial to learn an advanced level of this language, and just with the knowledge of basic syntax, I decided to delete JavaScript coding done. Therefore, the only JavaScript connections in this project are the set of libraries that Bootstrap needs in order to work, all the rest of the implementations were handling by CSS language.<br>
My second big problem was the navigation bar, my connections with Bootstrap were different versions. After a consultation with the lecturer, pointed the mistake. I linked with the different versions.

This was the main motor of my project. I did almost all the tutorials, from refresh the learn in class into real practice coding to advanced level. 
* CSS Only Image Distortion Hover Effects. Available at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_h4Bm9iu50 (Accessed:  Apr 11, 2021).
This piece of code I used to make images change when they have hovered over.

With different videos similar to this and in conjunction with the tutorial made, make the text animations.

Very useful tool. I also added some specific customize and little finals touch in all of them that I used. 


## User testing
* Two people tested my website. The first person was a relative who had a degree in Computer Science and the other was a friend who is a copywriter.
* The first person likes the home page a lot, he really enjoys it on the website. He said that not problems when reducing the size of the website and the content of a website flow a lot more smoothly creating a gradual informative experience.
* The second person said the way to divide the content into "differents parts" [layout for us] instead of just making a giant wall of text; it makes it much more readable the website.
* Both users reported no big errors about the site. 

## Considerations
I committed a lot of mistakes in the formatting, naming conventions, and commenting. I have a lot of improvement to be a good programmer in Front Web. However, I felt very proud of this job. Six months before, I would think never will be available to reach develop a site. With the comments of the users, I can say that I get part of the purpose of this project, it’s to arrange the content on your website in a pleasing and easy-to-understand way to improve the user’s experience and ease of use when on the website. It was a lot of time invert to learn new tools, and in life everything is useful. Mysteries paths! I know I oriented my CV to project management, but, this project created a sparkle new area to go.
