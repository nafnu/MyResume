## Running the Project

## Project Summary
This project demonstrates my learning in various programming languages by creating a semantic HTML and CSS website with a responsive layout. The interactive resume serves as a digital representation of my career, highlighting key skills to engage recruiters effectively.

## Development Process
### Contextualizing

#### Initial Ideas
In today's competitive landscape, having a personal website is essential across industries. Initially, I struggled to define how to present my CV. At first, I considered creating a single, large HTML document, experimenting with animations using JavaScript and React. However, my limited proficiency with these technologies made it challenging. After re-evaluating, I realized I excel at organizing tasks, which helped me focus on presenting my CV in a more professional light. I decided to tailor my CV towards project management, implementing simple CSS animations and using Bootstrap for more complex ones.

#### Layout
The design focuses on presenting content in animated blocks rather than long text blocks, making the website visually engaging. Responsiveness was a key factor, ensuring the site looked great across devices. The layout divides the website into four sections:
1. About Me
2. Portfolio
3. Resume
4. Contact Me
I opted for a bottom navigation bar, as it allowed the central content to take precedence visually. This decision aligned with the design concept, symbolizing a descent down a mountain as viewed in the homepage image.

#### Libraries and Frameworks used
• Bootstrap
• HTML
• Javascript
• CSS

#### Colour
Choosing the right colour scheme for a resume depends on the profession and the impression you want to convey. Since my CV targets IT professionals, I used a professional and neutral palette with black, white, and a third colour (blue or pink). White was chosen as the dominant colour for sophistication, while blue served as the secondary colour, used to highlight key sections. The design reflects a personality that is serious, confident, and determined—traits I associate with professionalism in the IT sector.

#### Challenges Faced and Solutions
One significant challenge was using JavaScript for dynamic elements. I encountered logic issues, and given the limited time I had to master the language, I decided to remove the JavaScript implementations. The website now relies solely on CSS for interactivity, with only the necessary Bootstrap libraries for functionality.

Another issue arose with the navigation bar, where I was linking to incompatible Bootstrap versions. After discussing this with my lecturer, I corrected the versions, and the navigation bar now functions as intended.


### References and adaptation explanations
• Simple CSS Tutorial (W3Schools): This tutorial was instrumental in my learning process, from basic concepts to advanced CSS techniques.
• Color Scheme Generator (MyColor.Space): I used this tool to select a colour palette for my CV.
• Simple Text Animations Using HTML & CSS (YouTube): This video helped me implement text animations on my website.
• Bootstrap Components (Bootstrap Documentation): I used several Bootstrap components with customizations to enhance the site's functionality and appearance. 


## User testing
Two individuals tested my website: one was a relative with a degree in Computer Science, and the other was a friend who has a UX/UI course.
• The first tester, a Computer Science graduate, praised the homepage design, particularly the smooth flow of content when the site was resized. He appreciated how the layout adapted seamlessly, providing a pleasant user experience.
• The second tester, the copywriter, highlighted the advantage of dividing the content into distinct sections, which made the website much more readable compared to a dense block of text.
Both testers reported no major issues with the site.

## Considerations
While I made some mistakes with formatting, naming conventions, and commenting, I am proud of the final product. Six months ago, I wouldn’t have believed I could develop a website like this. Feedback from users shows that I met the main goal of the project: organizing content in a way that is both visually appealing and easy to understand, improving the user experience. This project not only helped me improve my technical skills but also sparked an interest in areas I hadn't previously considered, such as project management.
